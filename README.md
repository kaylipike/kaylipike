I have hands-on experience developing software and contributing to professional projects, translating complex ideas into practical, efficient solutions. I thrive on problem-solving, learning new technologies, and delivering work with tangible impact. I’m interested in tech roles ranging from software development to data and systems work, particularly opportunities that allow me to grow my skills while contributing to meaningful projects.
